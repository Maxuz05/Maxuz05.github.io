      <p>Greetings, my name is Thuan Pham and welcome to this beginner’s first web blog entry. This would be my first time making a web blog page so take your time to look around my empty spaces. If you feel reading this blog is boring, how about chill out and watch some <a href = "http://www.youtube.com">Youtube</a> videos. Keep reading if you want to learn about my undeveloped self. Things I like to do is draw digital art, play video games, listen to music, and virtual fishing. What is virtual fishing you might ask? It’s fishing with a click of a button, but currently there is no application of virtual fishing on this website. Maybe I will plan out applications to fill up the website to create some entertainment. One of my future goals for learning programming is to create my own personal virtual space. This goal came from the inspiration and experience when virtual reality systems started rising over the years. Perhaps I shall also develop the foundation of virtual fishing under the VR system.</p>

      <p>If you read all the way until this point, thank you for reading my long string on nonsense. I hope you had a wonderful time and have a nice day.</p>
